== About
A project aimed to avoid downloading secrets from remote providers (support only AWS Secret Manager for the moment).
Opens an editor with the content of the secret readily editable, upon save & exit, the secret is automatically uploaded
and a new version created remotely. This way, no need to use common bad-practices such as versionning secrets in a VCS
or worst, storing them on your machine and sending them via slack :)

NOTE: This project is at its earliest stage a project can be, i.e. a proof of concept that might or not develop into a full
fledged project.

== Usage
=== Printing
Cat your secret in a nice format into stdout

By default the remote secret is read as a json secret and printed in yaml for ease of read. However, you can customize
this behavior to your choosing by passing the *print format* defining how you want your secrets to be formatted, and
*secret format* defining the format of the remote secret.
....
-e, --print-format <print-format>      The format used to print the secret, if the secret's
                                       format is `text`, this will be ignored and defaults to
                                       `text` too [default: yaml]
                                       [possible values: json, yaml, text]

-s, --secret-format <secret-format>    The format of the secret's remote storage [default: json]
                                       [possible values: json, yaml, text]
....

The output is pretty-printed, and color highlighted by default. Disable that by using `--print-format=text`

* YAML output (default)

 ‚ùØ‚ùØ‚ùØ barberousse cat /test/file --print-format yaml
   1 ‚îÇ ---
   2 ‚îÇ a: secret
   3 ‚îÇ another: secret value

* JSON output

 ‚ùØ‚ùØ‚ùØ barberousse cat /test/file --print-format json
   1 ‚îÇ {
   2 ‚îÇ   "a": "secret",
   3 ‚îÇ   "another": "secret value"
   4 ‚îÇ }

=== Editing
Allows you to edit a remote secret without saving it on disk (a temp file is created though... a more secure way to
handle temp files will come in the future, see #3). You can use different formats to edit your secret (json, yaml, plain text).

....
-e, --edit-format <edit-format>      The format used to edit the secret, if the secret's
                                     format is `text`, this will be ignored and defaults
                                     to `text` too [default: yaml]
                                     [possible values: json, yaml, text]

-s, --secret-format <secret-format>  The format of the secret's remote storage [default: json]
                                     [possible values: json, yaml, text]

--editor <editor>                    Override the default editor, $EDITOR, used for
                                     editing the secret
